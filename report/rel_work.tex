\subsection{The Freezing Robot Problem}
The \emph{Freezing Robot Problem} is a classic problem in robotics and consists of finding a balance between being conservative in terms of movement and safety and being efficient. If the robot is too conservative and the environment too complex could end up freezing because none of the possible movements would be considered to be safe enough. \\

Peter Trautman and Andreas Krause \cite{conf/iros/TrautmanK10} studied and proposed a non-parametric statistical model based on dependent output Gaussian processes that can estimate crowd interaction from data. Chung-Che Yu and Chieh-Chih Wang \cite{6395022} proposed a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approach proving that these kind of methods are efficient to both avoid collisions and freezing fee navigation.
