\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}


As a \textbf{future work} we propose some improvements and ideas below:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Would be useful to display a beep sound when moving backwards, such as trucks do, in order to prevent the people in the surroundings.
	\item The use of the kinect in the teleoperator side could be used also to add head control.
	\item The depth camera in the robot could be further exploited by being able to detect humans and behave change its behaviour.
\end{itemize}
