\section{Test with Users}

\subsection{Experiment Design}
The experiments we performed have two parts:\\

\textbf{Gesture Control and Collision Avoidance}: To test this part the tester has to teleoperate MASHI using our gesture control system and perform some simple tasks, going out of the laboratory room and coming back. The testers are also asked to try to collide and interact with the environment so they could test the effectiveness of the collision system. After the test the tester has to answer a short survey about the user friendliness and the efficiency of our system. \\ 

\textbf{Vital Space}: In the second and last part of the test we focus on the personal distance the users feel good interacting with the robot. We ask the users what is the distance to the robot they feel comfortable with and try approaching the robot to them.\\
