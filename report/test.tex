\subsection{Experiment Design}
We perform two different experiments, one for each peace of the project:\\


\textbf{Collision Avoidance}: Test the system against different possible environments with occlusions, tricky cases, moving obstacles, etc. With the feedback of the test we adjusted the different thresholds of the system, improving then the performance.\\


\textbf{Gesture Control}: To test this part the tester has to teleoperate MASHI using our gesture control system and perform some simple tasks. After the test the tester has to answer a short survey about the user friendliness and the efficiency of our system (Table \ref{tab:survey}).

	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Question} & \textbf{Answer}			   \\
		\hline
		1. Did you find the system easy to use? 	 & \\
		2. Did you find it intuitive? 				 & \\
		3. Did the system respond accordingly to your expectations?  								 & \\ 
		4. What would you improve from the system? 	 & \\ 
		5. Did you find useful the collision system? & \\ 
		6. Did you find the gestures commands easy and intuitive? 									 & \\ \hline
